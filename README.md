# Neighborhood-project
This is a single-page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit.

In my project I have chosen Google Map Api and foursquare Api. It's one page app that uses typescript with knockout.js binding and jQuery.

## Installation

* Get your Google Map API Key [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key).
* Get your Foursquare ID AND SECRET [here](https://developer.foursquare.com/).
* Clone this project to your local device (https://github.com/YuhanLin1105/neighborhood-project.git).
* Change your Google Map API Key in index.html.
* Change your Foursquare ID AND SECRET in src/js/app.js.
* Open index.html. You should see the "Neighborhood-project" like [this](https://my-map-search-project.appspot.com/).
